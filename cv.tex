     \coloredbullet\ %
     Developed a novel modification to a quaternion-based control system that optimizes control allocation within a quadrotor's actuator constraints to improve its stability and performance.
    
    \smallskip 
    \coloredbullet\ %
     Modeled and simulated a quadrotor's attitude and translational dynamics in MATLAB/Simulink to quantify the stability and performance improvements of the proposed control system.
     
     \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
     Adapted and extended existing C++ code architectures to facilitate prototype implementation and performed hardware-in-the-loop simulations, using Gazebo/ROS for testing.

\section{Notable Projects}
     \datedexperience{RandoSite.com}{Mar 2021 - Sep 2021}
    \explanation{Full Stack Developer}{San Francisco, CA} 
    \explanationdetail{
    \smallskip 
    \coloredbullet\ %
     Independently built an open-source web application that performs advanced Monte Carlo calculations for options trading, receiving praise from the trading community for its simplicity and accessibility. 
     
     \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
     Front and back-end development using the React and Flask (Python) frameworks, respectively. These services were containerized using Docker Compose to enable scalability in the software architecture.
     
     \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
     Used Python optimization techniques to reduce calculation times for a fast API that can serve thousands of users per second. Load balancing in AWS was incorporated to ensure fault-tolerance and reliability of the application.
     
     \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
     Integrated the Azure Active Directory B2C service for secure user authentication and convenient identity management. 
     
     \smallskip
     }
     \datedexperience{RandoApp Android App}{Jan 2018 - Apr 2018}
    \explanation{Full Stack Developer}{San Francisco, CA} 
    \explanationdetail{
    \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
     Collaborated with a team in building an Android application for monitoring the health status of trees in San Francisco. The app would assist the city in its urban planning and sustainability goals. 
    
    \smallskip 
    \coloredbullet\ %
    Implemented the user authentication system using the Android SDK (Java). Google Maps was integrated into the app to enable geotagging of trees and updating their health status by users.
      
     \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
    Test-driven development of all back-end endpoints using JUnit testing. The back-end was deployed on a Tomcat server.   
     
     \smallskip

     \datedexperience{University Space Design Team}{Sep 2016 - May 2018}
    \explanation{Satellite Control Systems Lead}{San Francisco, CA} 
    \explanationdetail{
    \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
     Led a team of prospective engineers in designing the control system for Rando University's first student-led Cube Satellite (CubeSat) project. The satellite would compete in the USA Satellite Design Competition.
    
    \smallskip 
    \coloredbullet\ %
     Simulated the attitude dynamics and kinematics of a CubeSat in MATLAB to optimize controller gains and to size our actuators for power efficiency.
     
     \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
     Implemented PID and B-dot controllers in Python on a Raspberry Pi for the attitude control of a CubeSat prototype, achieving a desired pointing accuracy of less than 15 degrees for our mission.
