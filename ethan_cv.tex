     Inspired by Cal Newport's 'Deep Work,' this productivity tool reimagines focus tracking. Disappointed by existing options, I built a personalized timer aligning with Newport's research. This NextJS application uses Docker, AWS, and a robust backend (Redis, Postgres, GraphQL, etc.) to deliver an optimized deep work experience.

    \explanationdetail{
    \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
     During my internship at Tangible AI, I developed and evaluated various information retrieval (IR) systems to enhance search results within a corpus of health documents. Starting with TF-IDF, I created a pipeline for processing and assessment, then compared results against a BERT-based vectorizer. This project, alongside Hobson Lane's 'NLP in Action,' deepened my understanding of natural language processing.
